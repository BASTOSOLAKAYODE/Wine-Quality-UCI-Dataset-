## Business Problem
Based on the data set, we have come up with these questions that we would like to answer in our analysis.
- Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?
- Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?
- Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?
- What level of acidity is associated with the highest quality?
